- Hi I’m Güldeniz. 
- I am a trained data analyst with social sciences background and experiences as project coordinator.

I have always been passionate about helping people to make informed decisions and enabling new opportunities for a sustainable future. To me, it is not only exciting but also necessary to turn complex relationships into understandable stories by connecting the dots. My experiences in data collection and face-to-face consultations taught me the importance of good and clear communication. As a project coordinator, I also learned the power of good-organization, team-work, creativity and positive attitude. My goal is to carry my passion of making sense of the world a step further with my new problem solving and story-telling skills in a company that I will be able to create great insights.
